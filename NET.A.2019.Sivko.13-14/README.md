1. Develop a generalized Queue collection class that implements the basic
operations to work with the queue, and providing the ability to
iteration by implementing the iterator "manually" (without using the block-
iterator yield). Test the methods of the developed class.

2. Create generalized classes to represent square, symmetric, and
diagonal matrix. Describe in generated classes
an event that occurs when a matrix element with indexes (i,
j) changed. Extend the functionality of the existing class hierarchy by adding
possibility of operation of addition of two matrices of any type. Develop unit-
tests.

3. Develop a generalized collection class BinarySearchTree (binary tree
search's.) Provide for the possibility of using the plug-in
an interface to implement an order relation. Implement three methods
tree: direct (preorder), cross (inorder), reverse (postorder):
use block iterator (yield) for implementation. Test
designed class using the following types:
- System.Int32 (use the comparison by default and connect
comparator);
- System.String (using the default plug-in
comparator);
- custom Book class for which objects are implemented
relations order (using the default plug-in
comparator);
- custom Point structure for which objects are not implemented
order relations (use plug-in comparator).
